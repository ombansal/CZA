        Dr Harsh Vardhan, at present Minister of Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Government of
India, was a practicing ENT surgeon before entering public life in 1993. He was elected to the Delhi
Assembly that year from Krishna Nagar constituency in east Delhi and went on to retain that seat in
all five elections in 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013. In 2014, he contested the Lok Sabha election
for the first time and was elected from Chandni Chowk, Delhi.

        Fondly called “Doctor Saab” by supporters and opponents alike, Dr Harsh Vardhan is known for
disarming simplicity in his personal life and transparency at the work place. When he was Minister in
the Delhi government (1993-98), the people found him remarkably accessible and officials respected
him for his hands-on style of functioning. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee once said of Dr Harsh
Vardhan:<b> <i>“He joined politics with the laudable objective of using his considerable medical
knowledge and experience for serving the common man”</i></b>.        
      </li>
     <li>
       As Health Minister in the Narendra Modi government for five months, he initiated many reforms in
the public health system of the country. He took over as Minister for Science &Technology and Earth
Sciences in November 2014 with the confidence of the Prime Minister who earlier held this portfolio.
He is committed to set a roadmap for the implementation of the “Make in India” programme by
building a robust R&D infrastructure and promoting synergies between industry and scientific
research institutions.

        The second child of late Om Prakash Goel and Snehlata, Dr Harsh Vardhan was born in December
1954. He has an older sister and a younger brother. Young Harsh Vardhan had his schooling in the
Anglo-Sanskrit Victoria Jubilee Senior Secondary School in Daryaganj, which is one of the oldest
educational institutions in northern India, founded in 1869. He decided to be a doctor and attended
GSVM Medical College in Kanpur from where he obtained his MBBS and MS with specialisation in
ENT. He returned to Delhi to set up a private practice as an ENT surgeon. But his restless soul, which
had manifested itself earlier and drawn him towards the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, persuaded
him to take up projects for the betterment of society. So, he joined the Indian Medical Association’s
Delhi Chapter and worked hard in east Delhi, which is his immediate neighbourhood, to build up
solidarity of medical practitioners. He held various posts in the Delhi Medical Association – from
secretary and President (East Delhi) to state secretary and President, Delhi Medical Association where
he showed early signs of his leadership qualities.
