               <h3 style="margin-left:1em;"><strong>Preamble</strong></h3>
      <p class="item">
 1.1 The growing awareness for nature & wildlife conservation has
made zoos a popular institution. Estimates indicate that 10% of the world’s
population visit zoos every year. There are about 350 animal collections in
India, which are visited by more than 50 million people annually.</p>

         <p class="item">1.2 While there is a history of scientific interest, conservation and welfare of
captive wild animals in the country, many zoos have evolved from menageries
and private collections, and most zoos until the last two decades were set up
mainly for entertainment and recreation. As wildlife resources were abundant in
the past, scientific knowledge about the behavioral and biological requirements
of animals did not receive adequate attention, with the result that scientific
management of wild animals in captivity has evolved slowly</p>

<p class="item">1.3 The need for making conservation as one of the main objectives
of management of zoos was realized by Government of India soon
after independence and the Indian Board of Wildlife made important
recommendations in this regard. The Government set up an Expert Committee
on Management of Zoos in November,1972 and its recommendations were
accepted in June,1973. The recommendations are relevant even now for
improving the management of Zoos. The National Wildlife Action Plan of 1983
again emphasized the role of ex-situ conservation in national conservation
efforts. However, because of varied ownership patterns and divergent nature
of animal collections, not much was achieved.</p>

<p class="item">1.4 Today when wildlife habitats are under severe pressure and a large
number of species of wild fauna have become endangered, the zoos have
not only to sustain their own populations but also augment the depleting
populations of endangered species in the wild. This new role has been
acknowledged by the global conservation community and Article 9 of the
Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

<p class="item">1.5 As zoos are visited by a large number of visitors, zoos are a potent tool
for educating people about the close linkage between protection of natural
areas and maintaining the life supporting processes of nature. Well-planned
and appropriately designed zoos can sensitize visitors to the dangers of a
hostile or indifferent attitude towards nature.</p>

<p class="item">1.6 In India, many well designed zoos were set up in some of the States
but for the most part, zoos have not been able to meet the challenges imposed by the changing scenario and still continue with the legacy of past
i.e. displaying animals under conditions which are neither congenial to the
animals nor educative and rewarding to the visitors.</p>

<p class="item">1.7 The amendment of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, in 1991, provided for
the enforcement of mandatory standards and norms for management of zoos
through the Central Zoo Authority. However, it is realized that the objectives of
the Act can be achieved only through co-operation and participation of various
government agencies, non-governmental organisations and people at large</p>

<p class="item">1.8 The National Zoo Policy aims at giving proper direction and thrust to
the management of zoos by mustering co-operation and participation of all
concerned.</p>
<p class="item"><b>Objectives</b></p>
<p class="item">2.1 The main objective of the zoos shall be to complement and strengthen
the national efforts in conservation and strengthen the national efforts in
conservation of the rich biodiversity of the country, particularly the fauna. The
objective can be achieved through the following protocol :-</p>

<p class="item">2.1.1 Supporting the conservation of endangered species by giving
species, which have no chance of survival in wild, a last chance of survival
through coordinated breeding under ex-situ condition and raise stocks for
rehabilitating them in wild as and when it is appropriate and desirable.</p>

<p class="item">2.1.2 To inspire amongst zoo visitors empathy for wild animals, an
understanding and awareness about the need for conservation of natural
resources and for maintaining the ecological balance.</p>

<p class="item">2.1.3 Providing opportunities for scientific studies useful for conservation in
general and creation of database for sharing between the agencies involved
in in-situ and ex-situ conservation</p>

<p class="item">2.1.4 Besides the aforesaid objectives, the zoos shall continue to function
as rescue centres for orphaned wild animals, subject to the availability of
appropriate housing and upkeep infrastructure. Where appropriate housing
and upkeep is not available, State Government and the Central Government
would ascertain setting up rescue facilities in off-the-display areas of the zoo,
subject to the availability of land.</p>

<p class="item">Strategy for Achieving the Objectives</p>
<p class="item">General Policy about Zoos</p>

<p class="item">3.1.1 Since zoos require a significant amount of resources in the form of land, water, energy and money, no new zoo shall be set up unless a sustained
supply of resources including finance and technical support are guaranteed.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.2 Zoos shall prepare a long-term master plan for development to ensure
optimum utilisation of the land, water, energy and finance.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.3 Every Zoo shall maintain a healthy, hygienic and natural environment
in the zoo, so that the visitors get an adequate opportunity to experience a
natural environment.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.4 Zoos shall give priority to endangered species in their collection and
breeding plans. The order of preference for selection of species shall be (in
descending order) locality, region, country and other areas.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.5 Zoos shall regulate the number of animals of various species in their
collection in such a way that each animal serves the objectives of the zoo. For
achieving this objective, a detailed management plan of every species in the
zoo shall be prepared.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.6 Every zoo shall endeavor to avoid keeping single animals of nonviable
sex ratios of any species. They shall cooperate in pooling such animals
into genetically, demographically and socially viable groups at zoos identified
for the purpose.</p>

<p class="item">3.1.7 Zoos shall avoid keeping surplus animals of prolifically breeding
species and if required, appropriate population control measures shall be
adopted. </p>
<p class="item"><b>Acquisition of Animals </b></p>

<p class="item">3.2.1 Except for obtaining founder animals for approved breeding
programme and infusion of new blood into inbred groups, no zoo shall collect
animals from the wild. </p>

<p class="item">3.2.2 Zoos shall not enter into any transaction involving violation of the law
and provisions of international conventions on wildlife conservation. </p>

<p class="item">3.2.3 Zoos shall not enter into any transaction in respect of their surplus
animals with any commercial establishment. Even the animal products should
not be utilised for commercial purposes. The trophies of the animals could,
however, be used for educational or scientific purposes.</p>

<p class="item"><b>Animal Housing</b></p>
<p class="item">3.3.1 Every animal in a zoo shall be provided housing, upkeep and health
care that can ensure a quality of life and longevity to enable the zoo population
sustain itself through procreation.</p>
<p class="item">3.3.2 The enclosure for all the species displayed or kept in a zoo shall be
of such size that all animals get adequate space for free movement and
exercise and no animal is unduly dominated or harassed by any other animal.</p>

<p class="item">3.3.3 Each animal enclosure in a zoo shall have appropriate shelters,
perches, withdrawal areas, wallow, pools drinking water points and such
other facilities which can provide the animals a chance to display the wide
range of their natural behaviour as well as protect them from extremes of
climate.<br>

<b>Upkeep of Animal Collections</b><br>
3.4.1 Zoos shall provide diet to each species, which is similar to its feed
in nature. Where for unavoidable reasons any ingredients have to be
substituted, due care will be taken to ensure that the substitute fulfills the
nutritional requirement of the species.<br>

3.4.2 For the well being of the animals, round the clock supply of potable
drinking water shall be made available to all animals kept in the zoo.<br>

3.4.3 With the objectives of avoiding human imprinting and domestication
of animals zoos shall prevent physical handling of animals by the staff to the
extent possible.<br>

3.4.4 Zoos shall not allow any animal to be provoked or tortured for the
purpose of extracting any performance or tricks for the benefit of the visitors
or for any other reason.<br>
<b>Health Care</b><br>
3.5.1 Zoos shall ensure availability of the highest standards of veterinary
care to all the animals in their collection.<br>

3.5.2 Adequate measures shall be taken by every zoo for implementing
wildlife health and quarantine rules and regulations. Appropriate vaccination
programmes shall also be taken up for safeguarding against infectious
diseases. Timely action to isolate infected animals from the zoo population
shall be taken to avoid further spread of disease.<br>

<b>Research And Training</b><br>
3.6.1 The zoos shall encourage research on the biology, behaviour, nutrition
and veterinary aspects of animals in their collection. They shall also endeavor
for creation of expertise on zoo architecture and landscape designing,
cooperation of recognised institutions already working in relevant fields in
this regard shall be taken.</p>

<p class="item">3.6.2 Zoos shall endeavor for transfer of technical skills available in the field
for zoo personnel. The Central Government, Central Zoo Authority and State
Government shall provide due support to zoos in these efforts. Assistance of
Wildlife Institute of India (WII), India Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) and
other institutions within India and abroad, having appropriate expertise shall
be taken in this regard.<br>

3.6.3 Zoos shall also endeavour for dissemination of information on
scientific aspects of management through publication of periodicals, journals,
newsletters and special bulletins. Help of non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) and government institutions shall also be availed in such efforts.
The Central Zoo Authority shall provide technical and financial support to the
Indian Zoos Directors Association (IZDA) and other institutions in this regard.
<br>
<b>Breeding programme for species</b>
<br>
3.7.1 Before taking up breeding programmes of any species, zoos shall
clearly identify the objectives for which the breeding programme is being
taken up. The targeted numbers for the programme would be decided
keeping in view the identified objectives.
<br>
3.7.2 All zoos shall cooperate in successful implementation of identified
breeding programmes by way of loaning, pooling or exchanging animals for
the programme and help creation of socially, genetically and demographically
viable groups even at the cost of reducing the number of animals or number
of species displayed in individual zoos.
<br>
3.7.3 Breeding programme shall be taken up by zoos after collection
of adequate data like biology, behaviour and other demo graphic factors
affecting the programme including the minimum number of founder animals
and the quantum of housing facilities available.
<br>
3.7.4 Programmes for breeding of zoo animals for re-introduction in the wild
shall be taken up after getting approval of the State Government, the Central
Zoo Authority and the Central Government as the case may be.
<br>
3.7.5 Zoos shall give priority in their breeding programmes to endangered
species representing the zoo-geographic zones in which they are located.
<br>
3.7.6 For carrying out breeding programmes in a scientific and planned
manner the zoo shall mark every individual animal involved in the programme
in an appropriate manner and maintain appropriate records.
<br>
3.7.7 Zoos shall take utmost precaution to prevent inbreeding. They shall
avoid artificial selection of traits and make no explicit or implicit attempts to
interbreed various genera, species and sub-species.</p>

<p class="item">3.7.8 Special efforts shall be made to avoid human imprinting of the stocks
raised for reintroduction purposes by providing off exhibit breeding facilities.
<br>
<b>Education and Outreach Activity</b><br>
3.8.1 Each zoo should have a well drawn-up plan for educating the visitors
as well as others in the community. Zoos shall keep a close liaison with other
ex-situ facilities in this regard.
<br>
3.8.2 The central theme of the zoo education programme being the linkage
between the survival of various species and protection of their natural habitat,
enclosures which allow the animals to display natural behaviour are crucial to
zoo education. Zoo shall, therefore, display animals in such enclosures only
where the animals do not suffer physiological and psychological restraint.
<br>
3.8.3 Attractive and effective signage methods and interactive displays
to explain activities of various species to visitors, published education
material and audio-visual devices are proven methods for driving home the
conservation’s message. A formal education programme should also be
pursued for strengthening the education message.
<br>
3.8.4 Beside signage, the zoos shall also use guided tours, talks by
knowledgeable persons and audio-visual shows for effectively communicating
the message of conservation to the visitors.
<br>
3.8.5 The help of universities, colleges and non-governmental organisation
shall be taken to educate the students about the benefits of supporting nature
conservation programmes.
<br>

<b>Extension Activities</b>
3.9.1 To provide the urban population with a window to nature and to serve
as green lungs for the polluting environment, zoos shall extend their expertise
and help to State Governments and local authorities to create nature parks
extending over extensive areas near big cities.
<br>
<b>Amenities to Visitors</b>
<br>
3.10.1 Zoo shall provide basic civic amenities to the visitors like toilets,
drinking water points, shelters and first-aid facilities. Ramps shall also be
provided for the benefit of visitors in wheel chairs for approach to animal
enclosure and other civic amenities.
<br>
3.10.2 Zoos shall not provide any infrastructure for recreation/entertainment
of visitors that is inconsistent with the stated objective of zoos.</p>

               <h4 style="margin-left:1em;"><strong>Preamble</strong></h4>
               <h5 style="margin-left:1.4em;"><strong><i>Background</i></strong></h5>
      
      
      <p class="item">The first National Wildlife Action Plan (NWAP) was adopted in 1983, based upon the decision taken in the XV meeting of the Indian Board for Wildlife held in 1982. The plan had outlined the strategies and action points for wildlife conservation which are still relevant. In the meanwhile, however, some problems have become more acute and new concerns have become apparent, requiring a change in priorities. Increased commercial use of natural resources, continued growth of human and livestock populations and changes in consumption patterns are causing greater demographic impacts. Biodiversity conservation has thus become a focus of interest. The National Forest Policy was also formulated in 1988, giving primacy to conservation. Hence this new National Wildlife Action Plan.</p>
<p class="item">
<b>Overview</b>
</p>
<p class="item">
1.	The term Wildlife encompasses all uncultivated flora and undomesticated fauna. Every species has the right to live and every threatened species must be protected to prevent its extinction.</p>
<p class="item">

2.	Water, wilderness and wildlife are irrevocably interlinked. With mounting agricultural, industrial and demographic pressures, wilderness areas, which are the richest repositories of wildlife and biodiversity have either shrunk or disappeared. Their continued existence is crucial for the long-term survival of the biodiversity and the ecosystems supporting them.</p>
<p class="item">

3.	Effective ecosystem conservation is the foundation of long-term ecological and economic stability. Natural processes, forests and other wild habitats recharge aquifers, maintain water regimes and moderate the impact of floods, droughts and cyclones. Thereby they ensure food security and regulate climate change. They are also a source of food, fodder, fuel and other products supplementing the sustenance of local communities</p>

<p class="item">
4.	India ranks sixth among the 12 mega biodiversity countries of the world. Conservation of biodiversity is directly linked with conservation of ecosystems and thus with water and food security. These together
constitute a major plank of Indian economy.</p>
<p class="item">

5.	National planning has not taken into account the adverse ecological consequences of shrinkage and degradation of wilderness from the pressures of population and commercialisation. As a result, we have witnessed the alarming erosion of our natural heritage which comprises rivers, aquifers, forests, grasslands, mountains, wetlands, coastal and marine habitats, arid lands and deserts. This has also affected natural phenomena such as breeding, ranging and migration of wildlife and geomorphological features.</p>
<p class="item">

6.	The increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the plummeting fertility of our soils and the accelerated degradation of our fresh water resources have imposed a crippling financial burden on the nation. This underscores the need to realign development priorities to take into account ecological imperatives including the protection of wild species, which sustain and enhance natural habitats, even as they depend on such areas for their survival.</p>
<p class="item">

7.	Rural development for communities inhabiting forest lands and other wilderness regions suffers both from inadequate resources and inappropriate measures. It has failed to address their strong dependence upon natural biomass resources vis-à-vis the shrinking and degrading resource base. Farm productivity has also declined due to lack of proper support, causing impoverishment and enhanced pressures upon natural areas. Resource impoverished communities have therefore begun to place even greater pressure on the biomass of our forests and has led to widespread alienation of people from the goals of nature conservation efforts.</p>
<p class="item">

8.	Habitat loss caused by developmental projects such as dams, mines etc. compound the problems of wildlife conservation</p>
<p class="item">

9.	The constraining impact of habitat loss has been compounded by illegal trade fuelled by a rising demand of wildlife products and their lucrative prices in the international market.</p>

<p class="item">
<strong>POLICY IMPERATIVES</strong></p>
<p class="item">
<strong>Ecological Security</strong></p>
<p class="item">

To protect the long-term ecological security of India, the national development agenda must recognise the imperative of identifying and protecting natural ecosystems from over-exploitation, contamination and degradation. Short
term economic gains must not be permitted to undermine ecological security.</p>
<p class="item">
<strong> Priority to Conservation</strong></p>

<p class="item">Assigning conservation a high priority both at the level of central and state governments is an imperative. Its integration in all development programmes, evolving appropriate funding mechanism, enhancement of financial allocations and provision of adequate personnel with requisite expertise has to be ensured, to arrest the ongoing trend of degradation and to restore wildlife and its habitat.</p>

<p class="item"><strong>National Land Use Policy:</strong></p>

<p class="item">The NWAP cannot be executed in isolation. Wildlife conservation cannot be restricted to national parks and sanctuaries. Areas outside the protected area network are often vital ecological corridor links and must be protected to prevent isolation of fragments of biodiversity, which will not survive in the long run. Land and water use policies will need to accept the imperative of strictly protecting ecologically fragile habitats and regulating use elsewhere.</p>

<p class="item"><strong>Primacy for Water and Sustenance:</strong></p>

<p class="item">Water must be recognised as a prime produce of natural forests. Forests must be managed to optimise and protect hydrological systems. The National Forest Policy of 1988 which emphasises conserving our natural heritage in the form of natural forests, flora and fauna, is in consonance with this imperative. A critical imperative is also to recognise forest, wetlands and other natural habitats as a source of survival for millions of people, in particular as a source of NTFP and aquatic resources.
</p>
<p class="item"><strong>In situ Conservation</strong></p>

<p class="item">Primacy must be accorded to in situ conservation, the sheet anchor of wildlife conservation. Ex situ measures in zoological parks and gene banks may supplement this objective, without depleting scarce wild resources.</p>

<p class="item"><strong>Peoples’ Support for Wildlife</strong></p>
<p class="item">
Local communities traditionally depend on natural biomass and they must, therefore, have the first lien on such resources. Such benefits must be subject to assumption of a basic responsibility to protect and conserve these resources by suitably modifying unsustainable activities. Conservation programmes must attempt to reconcile livelihood security with wildlife
protection through creative zonation and by adding new Protected Area (PA) categories in consultation with local communities, such as an inviolate core, conservation buffer, community buffer and multiple use areas.</p>
<p class="item">
<strong>Man-Animal Conflict</strong>
</p>
<p class="item">While increasing man-animal conflict is an outcome of shrinkage, fragmentation and deterioration of habitats, it has caused destruction of wildlife and generated animosity against wild animals and protected areas. This is a crucial management issue, which needs to be addressed through innovative approaches.</p>

<p class="item"><strong>STRATEGY FOR ACTION</strong>

Adopting and implementing strategies and needs outlined above will call for action covering the following parameters:<br>

III Conservation of Wild and Endangered Species and their Habitats.<br>
 IX Conservation Awareness and Education</p>
<p class="item"><b>
III	Conservation of Wild and Endangered Species and their habitats: Overview and Objectives</b>

The aim of the NWAP is to conserve in situ all taxa of flora and fauna along with the full range of ecosystems they inhabit. The ecological requirements for the survival of threatened, rare and endangered species, together with their community associations of flora and fauna, must be ensured.</p>

<p class="item">The isolation of animal species due to fragmentation of habitats reduces relict populations to unviable levels, leading to local extinction. For highly endangered species like the Great Indian Bustard, Bengal Florican, Asiatic Lion, Wild Buffalo, Dugong, the Manipur Brow Antlered Deer and the like, alternative homes are imperative. Where in situ conservation efforts are unlikely to succeed, ex situ captive breeding and rehabilitation measures may be necessary, in tandem with the preparation of their wild habitats to receive back captive populations, specially in respect of lesser-known species where status and distribution of wild animals are not fully known</p>

<p class="item">Alteration of genetic purity of certain wild species through inbreeding with domesticated, feral counterparts is yet another grave impending threat, seriously jeopardising genetic purity of species like the Wild Buffalo, Wild
Pig and Jungle Fowl. It must be ensured that natural phenomena involving inter alia pollination, breeding, feeding , movements and migrations are not hampered but assisted.</p>

<p class="item"><b>Action required</b><br>

1.	To undertake a programme of ex situ captive breeding and rehabilitation in the wild for critically endangered species in accordance with IUCN guidelines, after developing requisite techniques and capabilities in this regard.</p>
<p class="item"><b>
Priority Projects</b>

Develop capabilities for planned breeding and reintroduction of captive bred populations of identified endangered species in accordance with IUCN guidelines.<br>

Timing : To start in 2003 and ongoing<br>

Responsibility : CZA , State Governments, and Scientific Institutions.</p>
<p class="item"><b>
IX.	CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND PROTECTED AREA INTERPRETATION</b><br>

<b>Overview and Objectives</b></br>

To win support for wildlife conservation by explaining the rationale behind the protection of natural ecosystems to politicians, legislators, judges, planners, technocrats and bureaucrats who manage the nation. To elicit broad-based public support from different sections of society, particularly communities neighbouring PAs and forests. To convey a sense of urgency to young people and win their support for the protection of India’s natural heritage. To inform and involve the media on issues surrounding wildlife conservation and to highlight the connections between destabilised ecosystems and the falling quality of human life. To explain the connection between healthy ecosystems and India’s water and food security.</p>
<p class="item"><b>
Action required</b><br>

1.	Training personnel, especially from local communities, for wildlife education so that they cay be employed as interpreters/guides at PAs, Zoological Gardens, Natural History Museums, etc.<br>

2.	Enhance the role of zoos as centres of conservation awareness.</p>
<p class="item"><b>
Priority projects:</b><br>

1.	Encourage creation of nature immersing enclosures for display of wild animals in zoos and explain ecological linkages of species displayed through appropriate signage.

Timing: To start in 2003 and ongoing.

Responsibility: CZA, State/UT Governments and NGOs.</p>

                                                The rapid decline of wild animals and birds in India has been a cause of grave concern. Some wild animals and birds have already become extinct in the country and others are in the danger of being so. Areas which were once teeming with wild life have become devoid of it and even in Sanctuaries and National Park the protection afforded to wild life needed to be improved. The wild Birds and Animals Protection Act, 1912 (8 of 1912) had become completely outmoded. The existing State laws were not only outdated but provided punishments which were not commensurate with the offence and the financial benefits which accrued from poaching and trade in wild life produce. An urgent need for introducing a comprehensive legislation, which would provide protection to wild animals and birds, was felt by the Government. But the Central Government had no power to make a law in this regards as the subject-matter related to entry 20 of the State list in the Seventh Schedule. Different State Legislatures also found that the State laws were not adequate to deal with the matter effectively. The Legislatures of the State of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal passed subject. Accordingly the Wild Life (Protection) Bill was introduced in the Parliament.<br><br> 
                                                
 <strong>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</strong><br>
 
 The rapid decline of India’s wild animals and birds, one of the richest and most varied in the world, has been a cause of grave concern. Some wild animals and birds have already become extinct in this country and others are in the danger of being so. Areas which were once teeming with life have become devoid of it and even in Santuaries and National Parks the protection affordable to wild life needs to be improved. The Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act, 1912 (8 of 1912), has become completely outmoded. The existing State laws are not only outdated but provide punishments which accrue from poaching and trade in the wild life produce. Further such laws mainly relate to control of hunting and do not emphasis the other factors which are also prime reasons for the decline of India’s wild life, namely, taxidermy and trade in wild life and products derived therefrom.

   2. The abbreviation “spp.” is used to denote all species of a higher taxon.<br>
3. Other references to taxa higher than species are for the purposes of information or classification only. The
common names included after the scientific names of families are for reference only. They are intended to
indicate the species within the family concerned that are included in the Appendices. In most cases this is
not all of the species within the family.<br>
4. The following abbreviations are used for plant taxa below the level of species:<br>
a) “ssp.” is used to denote subspecies; and<br>
b) “var(s).” is used to denote variety (varieties).<br>
5. As none of the species or higher taxa of FLORA included in Appendix I is annotated to the effect that its<br>
hybrids shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Article III of the Convention, this means that
artificially propagated hybrids produced from one or more of these species or taxa may be traded with a
certificate of artificial propagation, and that seeds and pollen (including pollinia), cut flowers, seedling or
tissue cultures obtained in vitro, in solid or liquid media, transported in sterile containers of these hybrids are
not subject to the provisions of the Convention.<br>
6. The names of the countries in parentheses placed against the names of species in Appendix III are those of
the Parties submitting these species for inclusion in this Appendix.<br>
7. When a species is included in one of the Appendices, all parts and derivatives of the species are also
included in the same Appendix unless the species is annotated to indicate that only specific parts and
derivatives are included. The symbol # followed by a number placed against the name of a species or higher
taxon included in Appendix II or III refers to a footnote that indicates the parts or derivatives of plants that
are designated as 'specimens' subject to the provisions of the Convention in accordance with Article I,
paragraph (b), subparagraph (iii).
