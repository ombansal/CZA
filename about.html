<p style="color:#000; font-size:15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, functioning of zoos is regulated by an autonomous statutory body called Central Zoo Authority which has been constituted under the Wild Life (Protection) Act.  The Authority consists of a Chairman, ten members and a Member Secretary.<br>
The main objective of the authority is to complement the national effort in conservation of wild life. Standards and norms for housing, upkeep, health care and overall management of animals in zoos has been laid down under the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 1992.   
<br>
Every zoo in the country is required to obtain recognition from the Authority for its operation. The Authority evaluates the zoos with reference to the parameters prescribed under the Rules and grants recognition accordingly.  Zoos which have no potential to come up to the prescribed standards and norms may be refused recognition and asked to close down.
<br>
The Authority’s role is more of a facilitator than a regulator.  It, therefore, provides technical and financial assistance to such zoos which have the potential to attain the desired standard in animal management.   Only such captive facilities which have neither the managerial skills nor the requisite resources are asked to close down.
<br>
Apart from the primary function of grant of recognition and release of financial assistance, the Central Zoo Authority also regulates the exchange of animals of endangered category listed under Schedule-I and II of the Wildlife (Protection Act) among zoos.  
<br>
Exchange of animals between Indian and foreign zoos is also approved by the Authority before the requisite clearances under EXIM Policy and the CITES permits are issued by the competent authority.  
<br>
The Authority also coordinates and implements programmes on capacity building of zoo personnel, planned conservation breeding programmes and ex-situ research including biotechnological intervention for conservation of species for complementing in-situ conservation efforts in the country. 
                               </p>
    <p style="color:#000; font-size:14px;">
    <strong>Vision</strong><br>
Central Zoo Authority’s vision is to complement and strengthen the national efforts in conservation of the biodiversity of the country, particularly the fauna through the ex-situ conservation linked with in-situ practices.
    </p>
  <p style="color:#000; font-size:14px;">
    <strong>Mission</strong><br>
Central Zoo Authority’s mission is to provide better upkeep and veterinary care to the wild animal housed in zoos in India and also to ensure their conservation through best practices of management and bringing education & awareness among the people.    </p>
     <p style="color:#000; font-size:14px;">
    <strong>Functions</strong><br>
The Central Zoo Authority has been assigned following functions under Section 38 (C) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972:

                  Dr Harsh Vardhan, at present Minister of Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Government of
India, was a practicing ENT surgeon before entering public life in 1993. He was elected to the Delhi
Assembly that year from Krishna Nagar constituency in east Delhi and went on to retain that seat in
all five elections in 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013. In 2014, he contested the Lok Sabha election
for the first time and was elected from Chandni Chowk, Delhi.        
  <br>
      <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px">&#xe127;</span>	
       Fondly called “Doctor Saab” by supporters and opponents alike, Dr Harsh Vardhan is known for
disarming simplicity in his personal life and transparency at the work place. When he was Minister in
the Delhi government (1993-98), the people found him remarkably accessible and officials respected
him for his hands-on style of functioning. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee once said of Dr Harsh
Vardhan:<b> <i>“He joined politics with the laudable objective of using his considerable medical
knowledge and experience for serving the common man”</i></b>.        
<br>

     <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px">&#xe127;</span>	
       As Health Minister in the Narendra Modi government for five months, he initiated many reforms in
the public health system of the country. He took over as Minister for Science &Technology and Earth
Sciences in November 2014 with the confidence of the Prime Minister who earlier held this portfolio.
He is committed to set a roadmap for the implementation of the “Make in India” programme by
building a robust R&D infrastructure and promoting synergies between industry and scientific
research institutions.      
      <br>
   
                
                
			</p>
			<p class="more" style="text-align:justify; color:#000;">
		<span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px">&#xe127;</span>		
        Given his remarkable achievements, Dr Harsh Vardhan maintains a low profile. A RSS activist since
childhood, he retains the Swayamsevak’s tendency to downplay the “Swayam” giving precedence to
“Seva”. Few who follow Indian politics are aware that Dr Harsh Vardhan had pioneered the Pulse
Polio programme in India. He launched it first in Delhi, his home city, which was then home to 10 per
cent of polio cases in India (60% of the whole world’s cases were in India). In 1994, on a single day
(October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi), he organised the mass immunisation of 1.2 million
children. No immunisation programme in India before that had involved the marshalling of such
awesome logistics. Interestingly, the entire programme was also supported by school children who
acted as “Polio Sena and Polio Sainiks”, apart from activists from over 400 NGOs, the RSS and
thousands of people from all walks of life.       
    <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>		
     But Dr Harsh Vardhan had bigger plans. He dared to visualise a polio-free India, which could only be
possible if a regular Pulse Polio campaign was held on a national scale. At first, experts, both Indian
and foreign, discounted the possibility of holding it because of the awesome number of doctors,
paramedics, volunteers and administrators that would have to be assembled on a single day across the
country. Remember, it was the age before Internet, mobile phones and widespread
telecommunications and power. Yet, undaunted by these challenges, Dr Harsh Vardhan went around
the country persuading the health ministers of all the states to cooperate in making Pulse Polio a
success. In the past, no state-level health minister had ever succeeded in recruiting such widespread,
bipartisan support for anything, leave alone a <b>polio eradication programme</b>.       
    
     <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>		
    Today, Pulse Polio is a fact of life in India. On 13th Janaury 2012 India completed one full year
without a case of polio being reported, the last case in the country having been reported on 13th
January 2011 at Howrah, West Bengal (read article ‘India is almost free of polio’ in Pioneer dated
13th January 2012).   
    <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	
    But there are other scourges to tackle also. Dr Harsh Vardhan moved next to control tobacco
consumption. As an ENT specialist, he was regularly confronting cases of laryngeal, oral and lung
cancers – all attributable to tobacco use. So he conceived the first ever anti-tobacco legislation in
India, despite facing stiff opposition from the tobacco lobby whose clout and arrogance at the time
knew no bounds. In 1997, under his bold leadership, the <b>Delhi Prohibition of Smoking and Non-
Smokers Health Protection Act</b> was passed. It was welcomed by hundreds of millions of Indians
who were directly and indirectly affected by the tobacco menace. The Supreme Court passed an Order
asking all states and the Centre to follow suit. Soon, other states followed Delhi’s example,
culminating in a Central legislation banning smoking in public places in 2002. Fighting tobacco is Dr
Harsh Vardhan’s passion and he has attended all international conferences on tobacco control in
recent years may it be Chicago, Helsinki, Washington or Singapore. 
    <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	
    Dr Harsh Vardhan believes that a society does not become “modern” by just changing its superficial
appearance. Progress and modernisation means adopting lifestyles that reflect collective maturity and
vision. <b><i>“You can’t call yourself a superpower if Health for All, Universal Elementary Education
and Environment Protection are mere slogans”</i></b>, he says. The World Health Organisation has
recognised his contribution to society and awarded him the Director-General’s Commendation Medal
at a prestigious function held in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, in May 1998. It was an honour previously
bestowed on the likes of US President Bill Clinton and football superstar Pele. In January 2001, Prime
Minister Vajpayee honoured him with Rotary International’s <b> “Polio Eradication Champion
Award”</b>. He is the first Indian to receive this prestigious award, which earlier went to former British
Prime Minister John Major, former President of USA Bill Clinton, former UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and a galaxy of other famous international personalities. At the function held in New Delhi
attended by a large number of international luminaries to hand him the award, Prime Minister
Vajpayee described Dr Harsh Vardhan as <b><i>“Swasthya Vardhan”.</i></b>   
    <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	
    
     He is one of the few politicians in the country to enjoy broad, bipartisan admiration. Former Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral famously commented at an international event: <b><i>“If I have to single out
one minister for an outstanding award in India, then my first choice will be Dr Harsh Vardhan”</i></b>.
Within the BJP, he worked hard to organise the “Doctors’ Cell” and established vibrant units in
different states of India.       
    <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	
<b> Dr Harsh Vardhan was conferred the Paul Harris Fellowship by Rotary International twice.
The International Institute of Polypathy based in Milan, Italy, nominated him as a Fellow in
1996. In 1995, the then President of Lions International, Mr C. Pino Grimaldi, awarded him the
Lions International Service Award. In 1994, he received the “IMA President’s Special Award of
Appreciation” and was given the “IMA Special Award to Eminent Medical Men for
Distinguished Achievement of Highest Order” for two successive years – 1995 and 1996. On
“Doctor’s Day”, July 1, 2002, he was named “Doctor of the last Decade” (Swasthya Ratna) by
the New Delhi branch of the Indian Medical Association for being the “noblest medical
campaigner of the last decade”.</b>    
  
    <b> A number of prestigious social organisations have honoured Dr Harsh Vardhan with awards
and recognitions. The Maharaja Agrasen Forum conferred upon him the 'Aggarwal Ratan
Award' in 1994. The Jain Mahasabha bestowed on him the 'Ahimsa Samman' in 1996. The
'Sewa Shree Samman' was given to him in 1996 for his outstanding achievements by Dr
Manmohan Singh, the then Finance Minister and former Prime Minister. The All India
Conference of Intellectuals conferred on him the ‘Delhi Ratan Award’. The Acharya
Kshemchand Suman Seva Samiti conferred on him the prestigious Acharya Suman Shree
Samman for the year 2001. He has also received the Vocational Excellence Award by the Rotary
club of Delhi Uptown for his outstanding contribution in serving the community with special
mention of his dedication and commitment in providing relief to the victims of the Gujarat
earthquake. He also received a Certificate of Excellence from Dr Bhisham Narain Singh, the
former Governor of Tamil Nadu, on behalf of the India International Friendship Society for
outstanding services, achievements and contributions. In February 2002, he was honoured at
the Polio Plus International Presidential Summit held in Mumbai in acknowledgement of his
commitment to the eradication of Polio. In 1999, Dr Harsh Vardhan received the Human Care
Award of the Millennium for excellence in the medical profession from the Chief Minister of
Delhi, Smt. Shiela Dixit, on behalf of the Punjab & Sind Bank. The International Institute of
Integrated Medical Science, Varanasi, awarded him with the Certificate of Academic
Excellence. For his services to the environment, Dr Harsh Vardhan received the National
Environmental Seva Samman at the 1996 World Environment Congress. Dr Harsh Vardhan
has also received the Rashtriya Hindi Samman in 1996 at the All India Hindi Sammelan by the
Dr Ganga Sharan Singh Rashtriya Hindi Sansthan  </b>      
     <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	
    A major pioneering initiative of Dr Harsh Vardhan was his act of implementing WHO’s Essential
Drug Programme, which revolutionised governments’ attitudes on public health care. Under the
concept, maximum budgetary outlay was apportioned to those drugs most needed by the people. It
was henceforth known as the “Delhi Model” and taken up by several foreign countries and at least a
dozen state governments in India. The Delhi Society for Promotion of Rational use of Drugs, which is
a powerful movement now, was thus born and Dr Harsh Vardhan continues to be associated with its
progress.       
   <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	  
    His missionary zeal touched other areas of health care as well. Under him, Delhi’s Maulana Azad
Medical College got the country’s first ever Department for Occupational and Environmental Health.      
	 <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	  
    He launched the <b>Matri Suraksha Programme</b> to ensure proper mother and childcare for Delhi’s
middle and lower income groups. The Cancer Control Programme, the Cataract Free Delhi
Programme and the Shravan Shakti Abhiyan for the rehabilitation of the elderly and the hearing
impaired, were begun under his leadership. His administration also launched the Healthy City Project,
the <b>Hepatitis B Immunisation Programme</b> and a Delhi Research Centre for Modernised Promotion
of Ayurveda. Two other significant pieces of legislation that bear his stamp are the Delhi
Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy Act and Delhi Artificial Insemination Act.  
     <br>
    <span class="glyphicon" style="color:#933; font-size:16px;">&#xe127;</span>	  
    
    
    Dr Harsh Vardhan’s fame as a committed health minister grew far and wide. Experts from all over the
world consult him and he is regularly invited abroad to address gatherings of medical practitioners
and social activists. His life-long commitment to polio eradication continues notwithstanding his
being in power or not. To this end, he also served the South-East Asia office of World Health
Organisation (WHO) as an Advisor. He is the first Indian to have been nominated to the prestigious
WHO body, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), in which capacity he counseled the
international body on developing policies on vaccines and biologicals. Apart from this, he has served
on the Global Technical Consultative Group and the Technical Consultative Group of the South East
Asia region for polio eradication. This is the highest body of WHO dedicated to the elimination of
polio.

         As President of the Delhi Pradesh unit of the BJP,a position that he enjoyed four times. Dr Harsh
Vardhan proved that an able doctor professional could also be a good organiser. Earlier, he had also
held the post of Vice-President of the party’s national unit. In late 2003, he was nominated President
